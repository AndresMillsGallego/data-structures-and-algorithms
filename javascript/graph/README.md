# Graphs

For this challenge we are tasked with implementing a new class, the `Graph` data structure.

## Challenge

- Add node
  - Arguments: value
  - Returns: The added node
  - Add a node to the graph

- Add edge
  - Arguments: 2 nodes to be connected by the edge, weight (optional)
  - Returns: nothing
  - Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph
  - If specified, assign a weight to the edge
  - Both nodes should already be in the Graph

- Get nodes
  - Arguments: none
  - Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)

- Get neighbors
  - Arguments: node
  - Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node
  - Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection
    size
  - Arguments: none
  - Returns the total number of nodes in the graph

## Approach & Efficiency

My approach will be to build off the work we did during lecture with Jacob and if necessary, do some further research online to learn more about the `Graph` class.
