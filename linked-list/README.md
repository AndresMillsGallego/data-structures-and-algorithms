# Singly Linked List

This challenge is our first foray into the `linked list` data structure.  
We started off in class 05 with Jacob getting to know the basics of the linked list, and even started with a bit of code.  

## Challenge

This challenge is a continuation of the class 05 lecture and will include the following:

- Create the `insert` method
  - Arguments: `value`
  - Returns: `nothing`
  - Adds a new node with the passed `value` to the `HEAD` of the list with an O(1) time performance

- Create the `includes` method
  - Arguments: `value`
  - Returns: `boolean`
    - Indicates whther that value exists as a Node's value somewhere in the list

- Create the `toString` method
  - Arguments: none
  - Returns:  A string representing all the values in the Linked List formatted as: 
    > `"[a] -> [b] -> [c] -> NULL`

## Approach & Efficiency
I went off the class lecture and then did a bit of research on my own.  The following 2 articles were particularly helpful:
